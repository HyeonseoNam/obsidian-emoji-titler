Emoji Titler is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows you to quickly add an emoji to the title of the active note using keyboard shortcuts. It can help you visually distinguish notes, for example, by indicating note's depth, or marking them as read among other things.

1. First, increase (+ button) or decrease (- button) the number of emojis you want to use, and set the emojis you want to use.

2. Activate a note, and press the assigned shortcut to insert an emoji at the beginning of the title.

3. If you insert a different emoji in a title that already has an emoji, the existing one will be replaced. It is also possible to delete using the same shortcut key.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Emoji Titler is to search for `Emoji Titler` in the Community Plugins tab of the Obsidian settings.

Alternatively, you can manually install the plugin by downloading the latest release from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/hyeonseonam/obsidian-emoji-titler/releases) page and extracting the ZIP file to your Obsidian plugins folder.
